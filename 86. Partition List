Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
Output: [1,2]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
-200 <= x <= 200







class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int x) {
        ListNode before_head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode before = before_head;
        ListNode after_head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode after = after_head;

        while (head != null) {
            if (head.val < x) {
                before.next = head;
                before = before.next;
            } else {
                after.next = head;
                after = after.next;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        after.next = null;
    before.next = after_head.next;

        return before_head.next;
    }
}
